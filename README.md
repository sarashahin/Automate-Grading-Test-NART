# Automate-Grading-Test-NART

This project focuses on the automated grading of premorbid ability tests, specifically reading tasks measured by the National Adult Reading Test (NART). 

The goal is to classify the correct pronunciation of words to assess cognitive ability automatically.


**Model Details**
The model is built using Keras with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. 
The input to the model is a Mel-spectrogram of the audio, which represents the frequency spectrum over time.




**Model Highlights**
Preprocessing: Converts audio to Mel-spectrogram features.
Architecture: RCNN and Transformer layers to capture spatial patterns in the spectrogram.
Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate model performance.
